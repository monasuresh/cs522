Implementation model
Mental model
Your Answer:
1. Implementation model:

Examples of implementation model are the hardware layer which is the physical layer consisting of the device's hardware components, the operating system, the android runtime. Google maps is implemented in Java and runs of the Android runtime. Google maps also uses various android frameworks for functionalities like location, sensor handling and network communication. There are also libraries for features like image processing, networking, and ui components. Lastly, there's the application layer where the Google Maps resides which includes the code, assets, and resources that are developed for the app's functionality.

 

2. Mental Model:

The Google maps app represents a gui with maps, markers, and navigation controls which creates a mental model for users to interact with. The user understands the apps mental model through navigation paterns such as pinch-to-zoom, tap-to-mark, and swipe-to-move. There's also the mental model for location awareness through GPS, Wi-fi and cellular data. The user also has a mental model of searching for locations, businesses, or addresses. Google maps also creates a mental model for proactive information delivery through notification and alerts.

Question 5

List the six Design Principles that we discussed in considering UX for mobile app design.
Your Answer:
1. Develop stories or scenarios to define requirements

2. Define what the product will do before you design how the product will do it. 

3. In early early stages of design, pretend the interface is magic. 

4. Create a persona of the user around whom you design the user experience of the app and make sure that the represented model matches the users mental model.

5. Identify the data requirements and the functional requirements.

6. From the context scenario, identify the objects, actions, and contexts. 

1. Goal-directed interactions reflect user mental models. 2. Don’t replicate Mechanical-age artifacts in user interfaces without Information-age enhancements. 3. Design principle: Focus the design for each interface on a single primary persona. 4. Don’t make the user feel stupid. 5. Define what the product will do before you design how the product will do it. 6. In early stages of design, pretend the interface is magic.
