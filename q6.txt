Question 1
15 / 20 pts
How do GPS receivers attempt to deal with the following sources of errors in GPS estimates?

Relatively inaccurate clock on the receiver.
Dilution of precision in signal trilateration.
Atmospheric delays in signal propagation.
Difficulty locating enough satellites.
Your Answer:
1. An additional satellite is added for measuring distance. This additional information is used to correct for the error in distance measurements of location when the wrong circles are intersected.

2. The receiver chooses satellites for best position triangulation in this case

3.  GPS receivers use models to account for average delay caused by the troposphere. Some receivers may employ dual-frequency signals to correct for ionospheric delays

4. Four satellites are ideally needed. There are techniques like dead reckoning used by receivers to improve accuracy. 

4. Use Assisted GPS (cell phones).

Question 3

What are the five sources of ranging errors for satellite data in GPS location estimates?
Your Answer:
The five sources of ranging errors for satellite data in GPS location estimates are

1) Ionosphere 4m

2) toposphere 0.7m 

3) satellite position data 2.1m

4) satellite clock 2.1m

5) multipath 1.4m

 
Question 4
15 / 20 pts
What is the advantage of angle of arrival for estimating location?
What is the advantage of time difference of arrival over time of arrival?
What is the advantage of signal fingerprinting over signal strength modeling?
What is the advantage of signal strength modeling over signal fingerprinting?
Your Answer:
1. The advantage of angle of arrival is it's robust to multi-pad effects. 

2. The advantage of time difference of arrival over time of arrival is TDOA does not require a reliable clock at the receiver. TDOA works by comparing the time differences between signals arriving at different base stations and eliminates the need for a reliable clock because it focuses on the difference in arrival times rather than absolute time measurement. 

3. Signal strength fingerprinting has a lower setup cost, cellular base stations used in signal fingerprinting are more stable and less likely to be changed or turned off when compared to Wi-Fi access points used in signal strength modeling. You also don't need the location of every access point

4. Signal strength modeling gives increased coverage. It's easier to set up the infrastructure.

3. Signal fingerprinting: Better accuracy.
